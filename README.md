### Hi I'm Florian

  
#### About Me
:mortar_board: I'm currently working as a PhD student at the University of Passau in Germany.<br>

But I'm also interested in other domains of computer science and electronics, like embedded systems, PCB design, machine learning and Linux. My favorite programming language is C++.
