## Hi I'm Florian

  
### About Me
:mortar_board: I'm currently working as a PhD student at the University of Passau in Germany.<br>
:key: My research interests are in the domain of IT-Security and Hardware security. Currently I'm focusing on the development  of hardware trust anchors within different types of memories. 
But I'm also interested in other domains of computer science and electronics, like embedded systems, PCB design, machine learning and Linux. My favorite programming language is C++.
